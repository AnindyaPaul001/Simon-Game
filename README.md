# Simon-Game
A classic Simon memory game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This interactive game challenges players to remember and replicate increasingly complex sequences of colors and sounds. The game starts with a single color and sound sequence, and with each successful repetition, the sequence grows longer, testing the player's memory and reaction skills.

Features:

Colorful Buttons: Four colored buttons (red, blue, green, yellow) that light up and play sounds.
Memory Challenge: Increases difficulty with longer sequences of colors.
Responsive Design: Simple, intuitive interface built with HTML and styled with CSS.
Interactive Gameplay: JavaScript handles game logic, sequence generation, and user input.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Structure of the game.
CSS: Styling and layout.
JavaScript: Game functionality and logic.
How to Play:

Observe the sequence of lights and sounds.
Click the buttons in the same order as they light up.
Each correct sequence adds another step to the pattern.
The game ends when an incorrect sequence is entered.
